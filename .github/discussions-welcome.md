## 👋 Welcome to bunctl Discussions!

Welcome to the bunctl community! We're building a production-grade process manager for Bun applications using systemd. 

### 🎯 What is bunctl?

bunctl is a lightweight, blazing-fast process manager designed specifically for Bun applications. It bridges the gap between developer-friendly commands and systemd's robust process supervision, providing:

* **Zero-downtime deployments** with graceful restarts
* **Resource management** with memory and CPU limits
* **Automatic log rotation** with timestamps
* **Boot persistence** for production reliability
* **Simple PM2-like commands** with systemd power

### 💬 How to use Discussions

We use Discussions for:
* **🤔 Q&A** - Get help with bunctl setup, configuration, or troubleshooting
* **💡 Ideas** - Propose new features or improvements
* **🎉 Show and Tell** - Share your deployment strategies and success stories
* **💭 General** - Discuss Bun ecosystem, systemd tips, or DevOps practices
